register a0 to a7 used to save parameters to a function.
a2 is used in printf holding the third parameter 13.

function f and g are too simple that compiler can figure out the value in compiling time thus use the value directly.

printf is at 0x628

ra should be 0x38 which is the begining of exit() call as the next instruction to execute after returnning from printf.

the output is 'He110 World'

for big endian we need i to be 0x726c6400

while printf("x=%d y=%d", 3) trying to print the nonexistent 2nd parameter. it will keep looking from register a1 and print its value as 32bit integer.
